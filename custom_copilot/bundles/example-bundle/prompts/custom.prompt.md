# Custom Prompt (Bundle-Specific)

This is an example of a bundle-specific prompt that is only relevant when using the example-bundle.

**Purpose:** Demonstrates inline resources in bundles

**Usage:** This prompt would only be available when the example-bundle is installed.

## Example Usage

```
Use this custom prompt for bundle-specific operations...
```

## Note

This prompt is defined inline within the bundle and is not available in the central registry. This is useful for:
- Bundle-specific workflows
- Customizations that only make sense in a specific context
- Avoiding pollution of the central registry with niche resources
